2.00pm\u20133.00pm<\/p>\n<p>Venue: Nuffield Centre<\/p>\n<p>Mindfulness is the art of directing your attention in a kindly and non- judgemental way. Studies have shown that it can be very helpful if you are prone to worrying about the future or find it hard to let go of situations or events once they have passed. The aim of the programme is to introduce you to the skill of mindfulness. It is a skill that requires practice, so we meet together to do some gentle exercises and our discussion is confined to information about those practices.<\/p>\n<p>This is a rolling programme and consists of six sessions focusing on a different theme each week and repeating throughout the spring and summer terms, so you can join at any time.\u00a0 Once you have completed six sessions, you\u2019ll have the opportunity to stay on and repeat them should you wish to and if there is space. This may help you to maintain a mindfulness practice. To enrol on this course you will first need to speak briefly with a Wellbeing Service practitioner.<\/p>\n<p>For more information or to book a place, email wellbeing-admin@port.ac.uk, phone 023 9284 3466 \u00a0or call in to the Nuffield Reception.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>From Stress to Success<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Course dates: Tuesday 24 January\u2013Tuesday\u00a0 14 February (four week course)<\/p>\n<p>Time: 3.30pm\u20135.00pm<\/p>\n<p>Venue: Nuffield Centre<\/p>\n<p>This is a skills-based course designed to help students understand and manage the impact of stress more effectively.

If every time you sit down to do some work you find yourself diverting to something less important and repeatedly putting things off to the last minute, then this workshop could help. Participants will gain insight into why they procrastinate and how they can change their procrastinating habits. It will provide well-proven tips and strategies to help you stop putting things off and fulfil your full potential.<\/p>\n<p>This workshop consists of one two-and-a-half-hour session.

completed by 30 April.<\/p>\n<p>The NSS is an annual survey of final-year undergraduate students across the UK. Last year over 300,000 students took part nationally, including over 3,500 from Portsmouth. The results of that survey are published on the <a href=\"https:\/\/unistats.direct.gov.uk\/\">Unistats website.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Eligible students can access the survey via a link in the invitation email from Ipsos MORI, through a link from their Moodle account, or by going online to complete the survey directly at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thestudentsurvey.com\">www.thestudentsurvey.com<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The results of the NSS are very important to the University and the Students\u2019 Union. Student feedback is used to inform how we improve our courses, invest in facilities and develop the whole student experience.<\/p>\n<p>Just as existing students may have benefited from feedback provided by past students, feedback can help prospective students when choosing which institution to go to and what course to study.<\/p>\n<p>The NSS takes no longer than ten minutes complete and is mobile phone friendly. All University of Portsmouth students who participate will have the chance to win one of 27 prizes from the University, which includes VIP graduation packages, \u00a3250 One4All gift cards and weekend tickets for the Victorious Festival.<\/p>\n<p>More information about the NSS is available on <a
