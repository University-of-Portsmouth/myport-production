a Q&amp;A with Bruce about the San Francisco Summer of Love and the Festival.<\/p>\n<p>The film documentary focuses on interviews with local people from the time and the popular music scene in Portsmouth, from the arrival of rock &amp; roll in 1956 through the 1960s and ending with early 1970s events.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, the Faculty of Creative and Cultural Industries will be exhibiting student work inspired by the Summer of Love in the Freda Swain Room.

From September, the space will host an exhibition about the Summer of Love and 1967.<\/p>\n<p>Dave says that he\u2019s excited to be taking part in the events, and that working with the University of Portsmouth, Eldon Building and the city\u2019s Art College history is key.<\/p>\n<p>&#8216;The Summer of Love and counterculture has been heavily documented almost exclusively in terms of San Francisco and London,\u201d he explains. \u201cThe idea that nothing happens in provinces is simply not true.&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>Dave discusses the importance of Portsmouth and the time period to him in anticipation of the launch of Autumn of Love, published by Moyhill, which will take place in the Harlequin Room at the start of the evening.<\/p>\n<p>&#8216;The Summer of Love has gone,&#8217; he explains. &#8216;But I don\u2019t think it ever died. Some of the ideas and practises are as powerful now as they ever were, but we have a much more mature view of what it\u2019s all about \u2013 and that\u2019s much more than rock and roll.&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>Dave explains that although many suggest the movement inspired by the Summer of Love collapsed by the early 70\u2019s, the changes and attitudes that people encountered, including new ideas such as the ecology movement and alternate approaches to spirituality, are still having an effect today.<\/p>\n<p>&#8216;Ultimately,&#8217; concludes Dave. &#8216;I want to say that it never finished.&#8217;<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>As part of a series of events celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Summer of Love, Portsmouth Guildhall will host Playpower: the 60s counter-culture and the Summer of Love this June.

We employ live art, duration, immersive and on-on-one strategies to provoke, challenge and engage audiences. VEX make work that aims to explore the contemporary experience and all the intricate moments that our lives present. Our aim is to produce performance work that involves its audiences at a fundamental level. By employing experimental and compelling performance devices we offer audiences a truly participative experience. Our works seek to explode the liminal space and engage audiences in liminoid acts. We make performance work that engages audience in the reflection of self and identity in innovative and interactive ways. We are interested in creating a new and original live art performance event that presents an immersive environment in which the audience can participate with agency and efficacy. We are a live art collective and are interested in the way in which performance can be employed to reframe the everyday and the mundane to generate new perspectives on our contemporary experience. We use the poetics of everyday action, tasks rules and games to create our performance work. Life is our found material and people are our resource.Joanna is an associate artist at the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.newtheatreroyal.com\/\">New Theatre Royal<\/a>, (NTR) in Portsmouth.
